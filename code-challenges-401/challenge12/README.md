# Animal Shalter
> in this problem we just want to create class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats objects .

## API
> enqueue(value) : inserts object into the queue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
> dequeue() : extracts a object from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach then return it .

## Approach & Efficiency
> enqueue (object) : using the enqueue method to the queue
> big O time :O ( 1 ) space :O ( 1 )

> dequeue () : using the dequeue methode
> big O time :O( 1 ) space :O (1)
